This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP: using the deprecated `mysql_*` functions.  These functions are insecure and have been removed from newer PHP versions.

The `bug.php` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.php` provides a corrected version using the MySQLi or PDO extensions.

This example highlights the importance of using up-to-date and secure PHP extensions for database interactions.
